About Me
My name is [Your Name] and I have been working as a Software Engineer for the past 5 years. I am passionate about solving complex problems and enjoy researching, experimenting, and providing creative solutions. My areas of expertise include Backend Development and Team Leadership.

Projects
Microcomponent
I worked on a project that involved deploying solutions to the cloud, improving time responses, costs, scalability, and looking for the best fit of the solutions with cloud tools. We implemented multi-data management and microservice orchestration, providing low-code solutions. Our stack included Cloud Functions, Workflows, PubSub, Cloud Storage, and more. We also used Node.js, TypeScript, Javascript, Graphql, TypeOrm, and other tools to build the project.

Firebase
We implemented Firebase as a database provider, auth provider, and notifications. We used Firebase as an emulator to run our solutions and code in local development. Firebase is provided by Google.

Cloud Function
We implemented low-code and multi microservices to provide solutions that can run easily and connect with all kinds of services that Google provides. Google provides a great environment to work with Node.js, adding new features and new versions to run in Cloud Functions. We updated our project to Node16 version.

UI Experience
I have experience in solving and implementing solutions with React as a support.

AWS to GCP Migration
My last recent challenge was moving a serverless project from Amazon Web Service to Google Cloud Platform. I learned new tools, new methodologies, new documentation, and implemented them as a team in Google Cloud.

Teamwork
Teamwork is quite important to me. I believe we can go far if we are on the same page as a team, helping each other and sharing knowledge.
